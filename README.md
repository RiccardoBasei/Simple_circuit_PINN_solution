# SIMPLE_circuit_PINN_solution
Implementation of the PINN solution for a simple circuital problem.
## folder content
* in `net.py` the network structure is defined
* in `analytical_solution.m` the analytical solution of the problem in the laplace domain is derived
* in `circuital_simulator.py` all the function to solve circuits with numerical methods are implemented
* in `RC.py` the network is trained and tested
